# INSTRUCTIONS
To run: Use Windows 10/11 (Confirmed working on Windows 11, probably needs adjustments for Windows 10), full-screen Hydraflow Express on a 1920x1080 primary monitor, minimize all other open windows including Civil3D. Donâ€™t touch the mouse during run.

Because of Windows 11's odd print screen behavior, ensure you only have one monitor connected to your computer, otherwise the print screen will appear on your secondary monitor and GutterDone will not see it.

If GutterDone fails, it will still output a failed Excel, you can restart the program with this failed excel and specify the row it left off at.
